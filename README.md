# burger

A full stack burger-logger app. On the server side this app uses Node and MySQL to query and route data and Handlebars to generate HTML. this app also follows the MVC design pattern. On the client side uses Bootstrap for layout and style, and JQuery to validate user input.

<h3>How it works</h3>
<ul>
<li>Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.</li>

<li>Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.</li>

<li>Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.</li>
<ul>
